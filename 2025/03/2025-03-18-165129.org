* SSE gotchas
[2025-03-18 16:51] 

** if not HTTP/2 can have limits on max no of open connections
- limits is per browser and can be very low

** Keep CORS in Mind
- when creating EventSource add { withCredentials: true } if you're sending a req to another server

** Make sure to close the connection
- close both from js and rails side

** Better to roll your own retry/reconnect logic, built-in one is not smart enough
- if you do use the built-in consider the `Last-Event-ID` header, this is sent when browser tries to reestablish the connection.
  - read this header and respond with a proper event based on it
