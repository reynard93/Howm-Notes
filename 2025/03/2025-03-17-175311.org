* Phishing
hacker creates a fake website
look at key you receive from the server and see if it is a legitimate key
- certificate is sent along with the key from the server
- how do you verify if a certificate is legit? > who signed and issued
- use `CA` to get your certificate signed by an authority

how to get your certificate signed by a CA ? - an openssl command

whole thing is known as PKI (Public Key infrastructure)
