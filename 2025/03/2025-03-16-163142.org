modern alternative to sprockets
for asset pipeline, there are choices to make for JS and CSS
- JS: importmap (default), bun, webpack, esbuild, rollup
- CSS: tw, bs, bulma, postcss, sass (nothing by default)
>>>  Rails 8 way book
* recommends a node-based approach for `JS` and not importmap
** you will need npm packages @ some point and importmap still struggles with msot of them
- recommended: esbuild
for CSS, suggest postcss, if you are into writing no css at all and just utility classes, go Tailwind
