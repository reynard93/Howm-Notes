= Reusability Concerns or Service Objects

<<< service objects
<<< concerns
Reusability for concerns: involves thinking about model-level behavior reuse across different ActiveRecord models. Concerns in Rails are particularly designed for this cross-model sharing of functionality.
Service objects are reusable too, but in a different way:

Concerns excel at sharing behavior across multiple models (horizontal reuse across different model classes)
Service objects excel at encapsulating complex operations that might involve multiple models or systems (vertical reuse of business logic)

In your specific case, if you need the accessibility checking in multiple models (Submissions, Comments, Documents, etc.), a concern would be a natural fit.
If instead this authorization logic involves complex rules or external services, a service object might be more appropriate despite the potential confusion with your API services.
