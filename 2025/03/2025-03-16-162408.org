* be aware of versioning, reading from git repo, setting specific env, locally
<<< bundler
* purpose of running commands prefixed with `bundle exec`
correct versions, because people tend to forget, bundler offers `binstubs`
<<< binstubs
they are small shell scripts taht load up Bundler first to ensure you are loading the correct executable
  (there are some included by default always : bundle and rails)
  you could add a binstub of a commonly used executable (i.e. a gem of yours) with some command
  now you need to prefix ./bin instead of bundle exec but you could improve it by adding this bin folder to your search path
  - or alternatively use direnv to manipulate your path whenever you `cd`
  - add this to your `envrc` if you choose direnv
    PATH_add bin
