* Symmetric Encryption
1. use one key to encrypt and decrypt
2. key has to be sent along with the encrypted data, risk of key being intercepted
3. to securely transfer the public key we use Asymmetric Encryption
   
* Asymmetric Encryption
1. put your public locks on your servers
2. private key to decrypt (usually private keys have .key on them)

   to generate a private and public key pair

to get private key
   #+begin_src bash
openssl genrsa -out my-bank.key 1024
   #+end_src

to get public lock
#+begin_src bash
openssl rsa -in my-bank.key -pubout > mybank.pem
#+end_src

only the private key can be used to decrypt the public key
the private key is not sent out
hacker only has the encrypted message and public key, but he needs the private key to decrypt

You can encrypt data with only one of public / private
It is not true that only the lock (public key) can encrypt data
** if you encrypt with your private key anyone with public key can decrypt your message
** but you CANNOT encrypt and decrypt with the same key
- dangerous ! public keys are easily accessible
