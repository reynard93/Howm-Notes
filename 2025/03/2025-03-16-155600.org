= Don't use instance variables in partials
[2025-03-16 15:56] >>> ~/Notes/2025/03/2025-03-16-155232.org
* it couples the partial to the particular controller that setups the variable
- you cannot freely reuse the partial when you want to render the contents
  #+begin_src ruby
    <%= render partial: "form", locals: { user: @user } %>

    # inside of the form partial remove @user
  #+end_src

  tldr: let your partials be agnostic of where the user comes from
